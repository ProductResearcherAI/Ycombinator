## Progress

### **How far along are you?**
We started by developing Jneuro - an algorithm that analyzes user interviews and generates structured maps of unmet needs with importance, frequency, consequences, and satisfaction. This technology was tested across 20+ projects in crypto, real estate, and nutrition sectors. 

Building on it, we created the `ProductResearcherAI` agent deployed in Cursor IDE (our current MVP for the ResearcherryAI platform), currently used by 10+ freelancers managing 5+ research contracts for product companies. The agent's effectiveness is proven across $12,100 in pilot research contracts:
- **3 minutes**: analyze interviews, fill guides, formulate and verify customer needs
- **20 minutes**: synthesize user patterns and generate feature hypotheses 
- **1 hour**: process focus group results into comprehensive reports
- **Proven in 7 sectors**: bankruptcy platforms, dental education, fire-safety systems, bike rentals, flower delivery, exam prep, music platforms

However, onboarding researchers to Cursor reveals critical friction: Git complexity, programming knowledge requirements, and lack of messaging platform integrations decrease productivity per researcher. To solve this, we're building ResearcherryAI - a no-code web platform that enables researchers without coding skills to create, customize, and monetize AI agents with built-in verification algorithms, messaging integrations (WhatsApp/Telegram APIs), and website embedding capabilities for real-time user feedback analysis.

### **How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.**
Kirill (founder) has been working on this idea for 18 months full-time. Started with Jneuro algorithm (tested across 20+ projects), then pivoted to ProductResearcherAI agent 8 months ago when identified human-verification necessity. Last 6 months focused on enhancing ProductResearcherAI agent within Cursor IDE and onboarding researchers to Cursor environment, validating $12,100 in pilot research contracts while preparing these users and projects for future transition to ResearcherryAI no-code platform. Background: 5+ years domain expertise with 2,000+ interviews across sectors.

### **What tech stack are you using, or planning to use, to build this product? Include AI models and AI coding tools you use.**
**Current MVP:** The `ProductResearcherAI` agent operates within Cursor IDE, leveraging terminal and file system integration. However, Git complexity and programming requirements create onboarding friction for researchers. 

**Platform We're Building:** ResearcherryAI as a no-code web platform using agent orchestration technologies:
- **Agent Framework**: LangGraph for stateful multi-agent workflows with graph-based execution and memory persistence
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: CrewAI for role-based task execution and collaborative agent teams  
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js with visual agent builder using LangGraph's graph interface
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI with LangChain integration for tool calling and memory management
- **Database**: Vector databases (Pinecone/Chroma) + PostgreSQL for agent rules, conversation history, and user workflows
- **AI Models**: Latest GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro with function calling and structured outputs
- **Agent Memory**: Long-term memory with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for context retention
- **Integrations**: WhatsApp/Telegram APIs, Slack, Discord, web scraping tools, and API connectors
- **Verification**: Multi-agent validation chains with human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- **Monitoring**: LangSmith for agent tracing, performance analytics, and conversation logging
- **Marketplace**: Agent rule templates, workflow sharing, and monetization ecosystem

### **Are people using your product?**
Yes

### **How many active users or customers do you have? How many are paying? Who is paying you the most, and how much do they pay you?**
We have 10+ freelance researchers and 3 companies using our ProductResearcherAI agent within Cursor. All have paid for research services where the agent was used, gaining access to the agent's ruleset in Cursor environment and subsequently will gain access to our future ResearcherryAI platform. We have a proven company onboarding model: clients pay for research services, then receive agent access for internal use. Our total revenue from these pilots is $12,100. Key contracts include:
- **ArbitrA ($1,000):** Benchmarking of a bankruptcy platform.
- **OHI-S USA ($4,200):** Research for a US-based dental education platform.
- **POST ($3,000):** User-flow generation for a fire-safety IT system.
- **BaliBikes ($1,400):** Market entry research for a scooter rental platform.
- **Trava ($1,000):** Customer churn analysis.
- **Vebium-EGE ($1,000):** Research for an exam preparation platform.
- **UltimateGuitar ($500):** Pilot for agent customization and learning Cursor IDE for developing agents for research purposes.

### **Do you have revenue?**
Yes

### **Where does your revenue come from? If your revenue comes from multiple sources (e.g., multiple products, multiple companies or a mix of consulting and this product), please break down how much is coming from each source.**
All current revenue comes from delivering research as a service using our proprietary `ProductResearcherAI` agent. As part of the deliverable for these paid contracts (7 confirmed, totaling over $12,100), clients receive access to the agent's customized ruleset to continue leveraging the technology internally using Cursor IDE. This validates the demand for both the service and the underlying tool.

### **If you are applying with the same idea as a previous batch, did anything change? If you applied with a different idea, why did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?**
This is our second application. We pivoted from `Jneuro` after learning a critical lesson about AI limitations.

In `Jneuro`, we created an algorithm that analyzes user dialogues and highlights unmet needs, handling interview processing, guide completion, pattern identification, and synthesis between multiple respondents into unmet job maps for segments. However, we made a crucial mistake: we removed humans from every node of the algorithm's workflow. As data volume increased, output quality decreased because results weren't verified by humans.

We learned that AI cannot replace humans - instead, it should amplify human capabilities for conducting qualitative research at scale. This insight was validated through our pilot with UltimateGuitar, which paid for agent training for their employee to reduce burnout from managing 3+ simultaneous research projects while doubling project capacity per researcher.

Based on this learning, we built `ProductResearcherAI` - a flexible algorithm comprised of rule sets where humans make decisions at every checkpoint. These rules adapt at each research project stage and form the operating guidelines for AI agents helping scale qualitative research. 

While this agent was built in Cursor IDE and secured over $15,000 in research contracts, further expansion requires a full platform for creating product agents accessible to users without programming skills. This led us to `ResearcherryAI` - a no-code environment for creating AI agents that solves Cursor's complexity barriers and integration challenges while ensuring human verification at critical decision points.

### **If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.**
No

## Idea

### **Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?**
This idea was born from desperate necessity. As a freelance researcher abroad facing mounting financial pressures (family obligations, debt, newborn son), Kirill couldn't secure traditional employment due to timezone and visa restrictions. Living in hostel in Argentina, he built the `ProductResearcherAI` agent to clone his workflow algorithm to survive financially.

The results were transformative: In just 2 months, Kirill secured 7 research contracts worth $12,100 - enough to restore his family relationships, move out of shared hostel rooms, relocate his family from Argentina to Brazil, and rent a beachfront apartment. His productivity exploded from managing 3-4 projects monthly to 8+ projects, analyzing interviews in 3 minutes vs. 4-5 hours manually, and generating complex user-flows in 20 minutes vs. 5+ hours.

But the bigger validation came from the decentralized impact: 10+ other freelancers now use ProductResearcherAI in Cursor, with companies like UltimateGuitar paying for agent training to prevent employee burnout while doubling project capacity. This proves the market need for AI that amplifies human researchers rather than replacing them. However, Cursor's technical barriers (Git complexity, programming requirements) limit adoption to tech-savvy users. ResearcherryAI will remove these barriers with a no-code platform, enabling any researcher to create and monetize their own specialized AI agents.

### **Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?**
**Primary competitor is manual research**, which costs companies $50-150/hour per researcher and takes 5+ hours to process a single interview. Generic AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) often hallucinate findings or produce irrelevant patterns, forcing researchers to double-check everything, sometimes doubling workload.

**Direct competitors include:**
- **Dovetail**: Analysis-only platform that requires pre-processed data, doesn't handle interview scheduling or real-time synthesis
- **User Interviews**: Recruiting-focused platform without analysis capabilities or AI agents
- **Maze**: Usability testing tool limited to specific test types, no qualitative research workflows
- **Hotjar**: Session recording and heatmaps, but no interview analysis or synthesis capabilities
- **UserTesting**: Provides testing infrastructure but requires manual analysis, no agent customization

**What we understand that they don't:**

We solve this with a **verified chain-of-thought rules system** that delivers measurable value:
- **20 minutes** to generate complex user-flows vs. **5+ hours** manually (15x speed increase)
- **3 minutes** to analyze interviews vs. **4-5 hours** manually (80x speed increase)  
- **8+ projects/month** capacity vs. **3-4 projects/month** manually (2x throughput)
- **90 interviews/month** vs. **30 interviews/month** with same quality (3x scale)

**Our unique advantages over competitors:**
1. **End-to-end workflow**: Unlike Dovetail (analysis-only) or User Interviews (recruiting-only), we handle the complete research lifecycle
2. **No-code agent customization**: Unlike existing AI development tools like Cursor that require programming skills and Git knowledge
3. **Human-in-the-loop verification**: Unlike generic AI tools that hallucinate, our agents maintain research quality through verified checkpoints
4. **Agent marketplace**: Network effect as researchers contribute rules, making platform more valuable for everyone
5. **Real-time synthesis**: Unlike manual tools, our agents provide instant pattern recognition analyzing all iteractions with customers

Our key insight competitors miss: researchers don't want AI to replace them - they want AI that amplifies their expertise while ensuring human verification at every critical decision point. This "human-in-the-loop" approach maintains research quality while achieving unprecedented scale.

### **How do or will you make money? How much could you make?**
We'll use a multi-revenue stream SaaS model proven by our current success:

**Core SaaS Tiers:**
1. **Pro Plan:** $150/month for freelance researchers (saves $2,000+/month in manual time)
2. **Team Plan:** $500/seat/month for companies (ROI: 10x through 2x researcher throughput)
3. **Enterprise:** $2,000+/month for large organizations with custom integrations

**Additional Revenue Streams:**
4. **Marketplace:** 10% commission on agent rules sales (projected $10K+ monthly from power users)
5. **Research Services ‚Üí SaaS Bridge:** Current $12,100 in proven revenue transitioning clients from service payments to platform subscriptions as they scale usage
6. **Training & Consulting:** Onboarding and customization services ($1,000-5,000 per implementation)

**18-month targets:** 200 freelancers + 20 teams (5 seats avg) + 5 enterprises = $80,000 MRR
- Freelancers: 200 √ó $150 = $30,000
- Teams: 20 √ó 5 √ó $500 = $50,000  
- Enterprise: 5 √ó $2,000 = $10,000
- Plus marketplace commissions (~$10,000)

**Total projected:** $100,000 MRR = $1.2M ARR by month 18, with 30%+ monthly growth trajectory toward $10M ARR by year 3 as network effects compound through marketplace adoption.
