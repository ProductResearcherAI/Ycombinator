## Personal Story & Problem
Hi, I'm Cyrill, Researcherry founder. As a freelancer, I was surviving with debts and a newborn son, managing only 2 research projects monthly, spending hours analyzing each customer interview manually. 

## Solution & Impact
To scale my research, I built an AI agent in Cursor. In just about 4 months I went up to 5+ projects monthly, analyzing interviews in minutes instead of hours. It transformed my life completely.

## Current Success & Problem
Today companies pay for agent implementation to prevent employee burnout while doubling research capacity. It provided work for mor then over 10 freelancers. But Cursor requires programming skills, limiting adoption.

## Vision & Opportunity  
Researcherry wiill help to create and orchestrate research AI agents without coding. Companies will scale up to 90+ interviews monthly per researcher, handle plenty of research projects simultaneously, and see potential revenue impact and actionable recommendations on how to address customer needs.

## Investment & Scale
With your investments and just 20 enterprises onboarded, we will reach hundred thousand dollars MRR quickly, helping companies to trully understand their customers and creating remote jobs for researchers worldwide.

Thank you!
