### Work Experience

**Jneuro AI (stealth mode) - Creator**
Jun 2024 - Jan 2025
Developed a proprietary solution combining human empathy with AI technology, using LLM prompt chains to automatically process user interviews and fine-tune empathetic neural networks based on researcher feedback about AI-formulated customer needs. Tested the algorithm across more than 20 projects in various sectors: real estate, investments, home renovations, crypto, children's education and upbringing, exhibition and event organization, alternative energy, and Islamic applications. Collected interview transcriptions that were processed by researchers trained in prompt engineering, from which artificial intelligence formulated needs that were then refined by researchers specially trained in deep empathy methods. Received first confirmed traction from our first paying user in the crypto sphere, investment crypto-platform rivo.xyz, where our solution helped them rebuild their product based on user needs after just 9 interviews. After gaining traction, without prior knowledge of Python or prompt engineering, I assembled and automated a chain of prompts for our proprietary algorithm for identifying unmet customer needs. The algorithm showed record-breaking effectiveness, building a map of common customer pain points by analyzing 3 interviews in 10 minutes, complete with supporting quotes, compared to the usual 9+ hours typically spent on this task. This breakthrough led to the birth of JNEURO. First JNEURO' customer letter of recommendation: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NiDko-SGqFUDYy23h17xJC3gZR_qn-lQ/view?usp=sharing

**Training Empathy&ProductDevelopment - Founder**
Aug 2023 - Jan 2025
Launched an EdTech course "Empathy & Product Development" for B2B/B2C customers. Trained 20+ researchers and product managers to use empathy in uncovering customers' hidden needs and creating value propositions independent of existing market solutions to develop products with strong unique selling propositions based on customer need mapping. Mentored course participants in customer needs discovery: • Led needs identification across 5 diverse projects spanning HoReCa, Product Management, Retail, Oil and Gas, Alternative Energy, and an Islamic app • Achieved needs validation through successful sales in 3 student projects Enhanced students' efficiency in identifying customer unmet needs, reducing required interviews from 10+ to 3-5.

**Leroy Merlin (CIS) - Outsource researcher**
Jun 2023 - Jul 2023
Uncovered hidden and unmet needs of construction foremen who execute interior design projects and source materials from Leroy Merlin Result: Grew Leroy Merlin's Telegram channel audience in CIS from 5,000 to 50,000 subscribers within 3 months by implementing the new content strategy based on identified customer needs.

**Garage Eight - Senior Researcher**
Nov 2021 - Jun 2022
Developed and implemented a system for identifying and addressing unmet customer needs Identified key success criteria for trading highly liquid securities and mapped traders' decision-making factors in selecting assets, broker' functionality, and price prediction tools Uncovered traders' unmet needs not addressed by existing technical analysis tools Launched the broker's fintech platform

## Accomplishments

### **Please tell us about a time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.**

I hacked the system of asset selection by stock and forex traders, revealing how brokers manipulate customers and profit from unsuccessful trades. Through customer surveys, I uncovered the real reasons why the majority of traders unconsciously use technical analysis instruments and how brokers exploit this pattern to manipulate users and profit from their unsuccessful trades. I discovered that these tools don't actually work due to low success rates and high market volatility. Instead, traders subconsciously use them to predict the behavior of other participants, particularly when others will buy assets due to increased interest or readiness influenced by certain events.

While working at an international brokerage company, I pointed out that their clients didn't need standard technical analysis tools to make money, and in 80% of cases, they follow these tools like sheep because of the authority of their developers. I discovered that people truly need indicators of levels where buyer interest or demand increases due to events or decision-making influenced by technical analysis instruments. I proposed creating and testing such a solution, but the company declined because it would disrupt their shadow business model.

Despite this experience, I developed a research technique for conducting interviews that synthesizes empathy and deep analysis to uncover and formulate customer needs independently of existing solutions—needs that truly motivate users to purchase products, even those they aren't consciously aware of.

Using this methodology in just 10 interviews, I identified influential user needs that led to a tenfold increase in subscribers to Leroy Merlin's Telegram channel within a few months after the company adjusted its content strategy to address these needs.

Additionally, in another set of 10 interviews, I hacked the process of performing Namaz and reading the Quran for users of a major Islamic app in Kazakhstan. I uncovered deep reasons why users were unsubscribing: instead of feeling connected to God, they felt guilt from reminders to practice Namaz when opening the time widget.

I proposed a hypothesis to change the widget display flow and product tests to offer reminders as an option rather than a requirement. Despite the clear value, the company refused to test this hypothesis due to religious biases. As a result, their app continued to have nearly zero user retention by the fifth day, as users stopped using the app due to persistent feelings of guilt.

By using empathy practices, along with methods for formulating needs independently of solutions, I reduced the number of necessary interviews from 50 to 2-3 to identify key unmet needs in a customer segment.

I can hack any market by uncovering unmet needs that existing products fail to satisfy, and based on these needs, propose a set of product features that will displace existing competitors. Sometimes my findings are uncomfortable for companies, because they change inertia way of thinking of their owners, but this mainly applies to the CIS market. That's why I'm looking for a way to live in LA and be part of the YC community, to meet like-minded people who can use my insights to create unique, world-class products that lead in value creation.

### **Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that you have built or achieved.**

During a tantra session in Bali, I met my future partner, and a month later, I took her to Turkey where we decided to start a family, conceiving a child just four days after her arrival. Despite being non-citizens, we had our baby in Argentina and have maintained a strong family unit for almost two years, supporting each other like founders of a family startup who initially didn't know each other, persevering through all trials, and even applying to YC despite the challenges.

### **Tell us about things you've built before. For example apps you've built, websites, open source contributions. Include URLs if possible.**

I created a methodological book "Jobs That Never Done," which describes principles for identifying and methods for formulating deep, unmet needs of B2C product users that current market solutions do not address. These needs influence consumer choices and determine the creation of unique products in the market.

In the book, I detailed cases involving investments, real estate purchases, healthy nutrition, genealogy research, HR, and many others. I developed matrices with examples of correct and incorrect need formulations, enriching the existing JTBD framework. Although I did not publish the book, I distributed it among my students, and the matrices and formulas described in it formed the basis of a neuro-research algorithm I developed. I coded this algorithm using a chain of prompts and prompt engineering after learning Python and prompt engineering from scratch in just two months
